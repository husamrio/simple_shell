# Simple UNIX command interpreter.
“The Gates of Shell”, by Spencer Cheng, featuring Julien Barbier
It’s time for the famous Simple Shell project. This is one of the most anticipated project and also one that will challenge you a lot about everything you have learn so far:

# Basics of programming
Basics of C
Basics of thinking like an engineer
Group work
and Learning how to learn
 #Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
Who designed and implemented the original Unix operating system
Who wrote the first version of the UNIX shell
Who invented the B programming language (the direct predecessor to the C programming language)
Who is Ken Thompson
How does a shell work
What is a pid and a ppid
How to manipulate the environment of the current process
What is the difference between a function and a system call
How to create processes
What are the three prototypes of main
How does the shell use the PATH to find the programs
How to execute another program with the execve system call
How to suspend the execution of a process until one of its children terminates
What is EOF / “end-of-file”?
0. Betty would be proud
* Write a beautiful code that passes the Betty checks
1. Simple shell 0.1
* Write a UNIX command line interpreter.

Usage: simple_shell
Your Shell should:

Display a prompt and wait for the user to type a command. A command line always ends with a new line.
The prompt is displayed again each time a command has been executed.
The command lines are simple, no semicolons, no pipes, no redirections or any other advanced features.
The command lines are made only of one word. No arguments will be passed to programs.
If an executable cannot be found, print an error message and display the prompt again.
Handle errors.
You have to handle the “end of file” condition (Ctrl+D)
You don’t have to:

use the PATH
implement built-ins
handle special characters : ", ', `, \, *, &, #
be able to move the cursor
handle commands with arguments
execve will be the core part of your Shell, don’t forget to pass the environ to it…
2. Simple shell 0.2
* Handle command lines with arguments
3. Simple shell 0.3
* Handle the PATH
fork must not be called if the command doesn’t exist
4. Simple shell 0.4
*Implement the exit built-in, that exits the shell
Usage: exit
You don’t have to handle any argument to the built-in exit
5. Simple shell 1.0
* Implement the env built-in, that prints the current environment
